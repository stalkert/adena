"Dear users,\n"
"we would like to inform you that the plugin YITH WooCommerce Ajax Navigation will change its name into YITH WooCommerce Ajax Product Filter from the next update.\n"
"In addition to the name, with the new release the plugin, textdomain will change too from \"yit\" to \"yith_wc_ajxnav\".\n"
"This change solves issues concerning textdomain conflicts generated by some translation/multilanguage plugins you have identified in the past weeks.\n"
"It may be possible that, with the plugin update, some language files will not be recognized by WordPress. In this case, you will just have to rename the language files with the correct format, changing the old textdomain with the new one.\n"
"For example, if your language files were named yit-en_GB.po and yit-en_GB.mo, you will just have to rename them respectively as yith_wc_ajxnav-en_GB.po and yith_wc_ajxnav-en_GB.mo.\n"
"After renaming the files, you can update/translate the .po file following the classic procedure for translations."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Recently YITH WooCommerce Ajax Product Filter has been selected to be included in the \"translate.wordpress.org\" translate programme. In order to import correctly the plugin strings in the new system, we had to change the text domain form 'yith_wc_ajxnav' to 'yith-woocommerce-ajax-navigation'. Once the plugin will be imported in the translate.wordpress.org system, the translations of other languages will be downloaded directly from WordPress, without using any .po and .mo files. Moreover, users will be able to participate in a more direct way to plugin translations, suggesting texts in their languages in the dedicated tab on translate.wordpress.org. During this transition step, .po and .mo files will be used as always, but in order to be recognized by WordPress, they will need to have a new nomenclature, renaming them in: yith-woocommerce-ajax-navigation-.po yith-woocommerce-ajax-navigation-.mo. For example, if your language files were named yit-en_GB.po and yit-en_GB.mo, you will just have to rename them respectively as yith-woocommerce-ajax-navigation-en_GB.po and yith-woocommerce-ajax-navigation-en_GB.mo."
